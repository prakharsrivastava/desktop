## Setup

```bash
# Navigate to this directory
cd 6_mcp/community_contributions/shopping_list_mcp

# Required in .env (project root) - choose ONE:
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_key   (recommended - FREE at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
# GROQ_API_KEY=your_openai_key   (alternative)

# Optional for Email + SMS notifications:
# RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key   (free at https://resend.com)
```

### LLM Options (All FREE!)

| Provider | API Key | Rate Limits | Get Key |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Groq** ⭐ | `GROQ_API_KEY` | 30 req/min | [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) |
| Gemini | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | 15 req/min | [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| OpenAI | `GROQ_API_KEY` | Paid | Fallback only |

**Recommended**: Use **Groq** - fastest, highest rate limits, completely free!

### Resend Free Tier Limitations

⚠️ **Important**: With Resend's free tier:
- ✅ **Email works** to YOUR verified email (the one you signed up with)
- ❌ **SMS won't work** until you verify a custom domain

**To enable SMS** (and send to any email):
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
3. Add the DNS records Resend provides
4. Wait for verification (~5 mins)

## Usage

### Main Assistant (Recommended)
Full-featured assistant with shopping list + email + SMS:

```bash
uv run shopping_agent.py
```

**One agent does everything:**
- "Add milk and bread to my list"
- "Set my budget to $50"
- "What's on my list?"
- "Email my list to spouse@gmail.com"
- "Text my list to 555-123-4567 on Verizon"

### Test Client (No LLM)
Direct tool calls without AI - good for testing:

```bash
uv run simple_client.py
```

| `add_item` | Add item to list | name, quantity, category, price |
